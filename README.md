# Dependency-Check Jenkins Plugin
Dependency-Check is a utility that identifies project dependencies and checks if there are any known, publicly 
disclosed, vulnerabilities. This tool can be part of the solution to the OWASP Top 10 2017: A9 - Using 
Components with Known Vulnerabilities. This plug-in can independently execute a Dependency-Check analysis and 
visualize results.

## Usage
The plugin has three main components: a globally defined tool configuration, a builder, and a publisher.

#### Global Tool Configuration
One or more Dependency-Check versions can be installed via the Jenkins Global Tool Configuration. The installation of Dependency-Check can be performed automatically, which will download and extract the official Command-Line Interface (CLI) from Github, or an official distribution can be installed manually and the path to the installation referenced in the configuration.

#### Builder
The builder performs an analysis using one of the pre-defined Dependency-Check CLI installations. Configuration specific to Jenkins is minimal, with important aspects of the job configuration being the 'Arguments' field, which is sent directly to the CLI installation defined.

#### Publisher
The publisher works independently of the tool configuration or builder and is responsible for reading dependency-check-report.xml and generating metrics, trends, findings, and optionally failing the build or putting it into a warning state based on configurable thresholds.

When a job has the publisher configured, a trending chart will display the total number of findings grouped by severity.

The chart is interactive. Hovering over a build will display high-level severity information.

Per-build results may be viewed. Findings are displayed in an interactive table which can be sorted, searched on, and paginated through. Each findings can be expanded to reveal additional details.
