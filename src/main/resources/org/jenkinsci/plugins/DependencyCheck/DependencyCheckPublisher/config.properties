                 setting that specifies the generated raw DependencyCheck XML report files, such \
                 as '**/DependencyCheck-Report.xml'. Basedir of the fileset is \
                 <a href="ws/">the workspace root</a>. If no value is set, then the default \
                 '**/DependencyCheck-Report.xml' is used. Be sure not to include any non-report \
                 files into this pattern.
